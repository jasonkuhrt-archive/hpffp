## 3.1 Printing strings

* "string"
* data structure used to contain text
* most computer langauges have this type/terminology
* usually represented as sequences (AKA lists) of characters
* in Haskell, a list of characters



## 3.2 A First Look at Types

* "types"
* a way of categorizing values
* e.g. integers, fractions, booleans, Char, String

* ghci `:type` will return type info for an expression

* "type signature"
* line of code that defines the types for a function or expresion

* single quote is character
* like C, .Net

* double quote is string
* like Clojure, JavaScript (though there single works too)

* "type alias" (AKA type synonym)
* a type name that has a different name underneath
* usually used for convenience
* String is another name for [Char]
