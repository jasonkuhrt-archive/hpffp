# Chapter 2 â€“ Hello, Haskell!



## 2.1 Hello, Haskell

* use stack to install haskell, haskellstack.org
* includes ghci (repl), ghc (haskell), and build tool
* brew install haskell-stack
* another guide to getting up and running with haskell is available at https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell



## 2.2 Interacting with Haskell code

* two ways of working with code
* typing directly into ghci, a repl (read-eval-print-loop)
* loading a source file into ghci
* repl originated with lisp
* `ghci` command available if haskell installed standalone
* otherwise must use `stack ghci`
* Prelude is a library of standard functions
* automatically imported
* can be disabled e.g. for an alternative
* Prelude library is within package `base`
* ghci has special commands prefixed by `:` like :info :quit :type
-}

sayHello :: String -> IO ()
sayHello x = putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ x ++ "!")

{-
* `::` denotes a type
* can be read as "... has the type of ..."
* in ghci use :load to load a file, path is relative to `pwd`
* in ghci use :module to unload the loaded module



## 2.3 Understanding expressions

* everything is an expression or declaration
* expressions may be values, combinations of values, functions applied to values
* expressions evaluate to a result
* expressions are building blocks
* a program is one giant expression

* "declaration"
* top-level binding that permit naming expressions
* example expressions:

  1
  1 + 1
  "Icarus"
* 1 is an expression, has no further reduction step, "stands for itself"

"normal form"
* an expression for which no more evaluation steps may be taken
* AKA reached an irreducible form

"redex"
* a reducible expression

"evaluation"
* AKA reduction
* AKA normalizing, but imprecise
* AKA executing, but imprecise



## 2.4 Functions

"function" in Haskell
* based on the mathematical function
* an expression that is applied to a (one) argument, returns a (one) result
* maps inputs to outputs

"argument"
* value passed to function parameter when function is applied

* b/c built purely of expressions always evaluate to the same result when given the same values
* multi-parameter functions use currying
* functions can be an argument to another function or nested in a function body
* to introduce functions in ghci `let` must be used (not needed in a source file) e.g.

  let triple x = x * 3
      ^      ^   ^^^^^
      name   |       |
             param   |
                     body

* Once a function is applied you can replace it with its body whose bound variables are now replaced by the arguments
-}

triple :: Int -> Int
triple x = x * 3

{-
## 2.5 Evaluation

* "evaluation"
* reduce the terms of an expression until the expression reaches its simplest form
* usually the result is called a value
* AKA application since applying a function to an argument allows evaluation

* Haskell uses a lazy evaluation strategy
* terms are not evaluated until they are forced to by another term referring to them
* this is to say that by default Haskell does not evaluate to normal form, but rather weak head normal form (WHNF)
* approximated example:

  (\ x -> (1, 2 + x)) 2

evaluation result in `normal order`: `(1, 4)`
evaluation result in WHNF:           `(1, 2 + 2)`

### Exercises: Comprehension Check

1. Rewrite these to make them work in ghci:

  half x = x / 2
  let half x = x / 2

  square x = x * x
  let square x = x * x

2. Write function that can work for all the following expressions:
  3.14 * (5 * 5)
  3.14 * (10 * 10)
  3.14 * (2 * 2)
  3.14 * (4 * 4)
-}

timesMiniPi :: Float -> Float
timesMiniPi n = n * 3.14

{-
3. Rewrite using `pi`
-}

timesPi :: Float -> Float
timesPi n = n * pi

{-
## 2.6 Infix operators

"prefix syntax"
* default for functions
* means function being applied is at the beginning of the expression rather than e.g. the middle

"operator"
* function that can be used infix style

* all operators are functions, not vice versa
* functions can be used infix style by wrapping them with backticks
* operators can be used function style by wrapping them with parentheses

* :info command in ghci can show info about functions including their:
  * associativity
  * precedence
  * is operator or not
* e.g.:

  :info (*)
  infixl  7  *
  [1]    [2][3]

* [1] is an infix operator, left associative
* [2] precedence, scale 0-9, higher is applied first
* [3] infix name

"left associative operator"
* means `2 * 3 * 4` is same as `(2 * 3) * 4`

"right associative operator"
* means `2 ^ 3 ^ 4` is same as `2 ^ (3 ^ 4)`
* means `2 ^ 3 ^ 4` (241...) is not same as `(2 ^ 3) ^ 4` (4096)

### Exercises: Parentheses and Association

Are parentheses needed in the following expressions?

1. (8 + 7) * 9
   YES, * takes precedence otherwise

2. perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
   NO, * is higher precedence anyways

3. f x = x / (2 + 9)
   YES, / takes precedence otherwise



## 2.7 Declaring values

* declare a module name so that it can be imported
* syntax is whitespace sensitive
* general rule is that expressions wrapped onto the next line need to indent at least one character, then stay at that indent level e.g.:

  -- error

  f1 = 'a'
  == 'b'

  -- ok
-}

f1 :: Bool
f1 = 'a'
  == 'b'

{-
* Examples with let ... in syntax:
-}

f2 :: [String]
f2 =
  let
    -- `foo` and `bar` must line up
    foo = "foo"
    bar = "bar"
  in
    -- `qux` and `wux` must line up
    let qux = "qux"
        wux = "wux"
    in
    let
    -- `fuf` and `bux` must line up
    fuf = "fuf"
    bux = "bux"
    in
    [foo, bar, qux, wux, fuf, bux] {-
    or even either:
      [foo, bar, qux, wux, fuf, bux]
  [foo, bar, qux, wux, fuf, bux] -}

{-

### Intermission Exercises

Fix whitespace or other errors.

1. let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)

   period in 3. 14 interpreted as composition operator
   fix:

   let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)

2. let double x = b * 2

   b is undefined
   fix:

   let double x = x * 2

3. x = 7
    y = 10
   f = x + y

   y indented too much
   fix:

   x = 7
   y = 10
   f = x + y
